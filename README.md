Description of webinar: 

`UniProt is a comprehensive, expert-led, publicly available database of protein sequence, function and variation information.

This webinar will give an overview of programmatic access to the UniProt database using Python and cover key aspects of protein entry searches, data filtering, batch downloads and give examples of further processing of downloaded target data.

Following a brief introduction to UniProt services, where to find relevant documentation and help features, the webinar will focus on worked examples. These will include how to programmatically search and retrieve protein entries and sequences, within the results. We will then show how to align orthologous sequences and filter for features of interest, such as disease variant information.

The webinar will also cover programmatic examples of the UniProt Retrieve/ID mapping service, batch downloads, processing, and filtering data by annotation type. `
